Tokay v0.6.6 is another milestone commit on the current roadmap to version 0.7, which should finalize the major feature of generics.

The highlights in Tokay v0.6.6 are...

<!-- more -->

- Improved and revised `list` and `dict` syntax
  - `,` is now some kind of operator, denoting a list
  - just `()` defines the empty dict, and just `,` the empty list.
- Implementation and use of `Keyword<P>`
- `Empty` and `Void` clarification
- Improved logging and debug
- Improvements on compiler internals like new `Scope` struct, refactored `ImlValue`

The new list syntax is the major feature of this milestone release, as it is not compatible to previous versions.
See the screenshot below with a REPL executed in Tokay v0.6.5 and Tokay v0.6.6.

For example, just specifying `,` defines an empty list. An item followed by `,` turns the item into a list.
