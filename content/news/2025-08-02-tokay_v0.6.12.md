We are pleased to announce the release of **Tokay v0.6.12**. There's currently much stuff going on under the hood.

Here's an overview about the latest developments from Tokay v0.6.9 until v0.6.12:

- Support of `serde` for several types. This made it possible to save and load a compiled Tokay VM program into CBOR-encoded binary file, which can be directly loaded and afterwards executed. Additionally, the parser is now being loaded just once per thread, which leads in much higher execution times.
- The compiler's handling of global variables fed externally was implemented. Now you can assign variables via `tokay -vvar=42` directly on the command-line.
- Tokay now compiles safely to WebAssembly (WASM). The [`tokay-wasm`-crate](https://crates.io/crates/tokay-wasm) compiles the latest Tokay release for WebAssembly and provides some entry points. So Tokay can now be used and installed as an NPM package in the Node/JavaScript world: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/tokay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tokay)
- [Tokay Play](https://github.com/tokay-lang/tokay-play) is currently under heavy development to provide an instant Tokay development environment running natively in the browser. It shall be used to try Tokay and do some real ad-hoc parsing right away in your browser!

As always, we are very happy to welcome volunteers who want to help make Tokay better!
